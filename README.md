## Description

Simple shopping cart developed with php to track the products the customer selected without losing data between the same session. This means that, if the user closes the tab or the browser, he won't lose data and be able to find the cart in the same state he left it the last time. It is also possible to reset the cart.

## Version 1.0

In the first session of the cart manager, it will be possible to select the items by selecting a dedicated checkbox everytime we want to add an item. After selecting through the checkboxes, the user has to add the items with a submit button, and so the items will be added to the shopping cart, counting the total amount of each product but not showing the total cost. It is possible to reset the cart.

## Version 2.0

In the second version, there are a few upgrades:

<ul>
    <li>Select items independetly (faster and easier).</li>
    <li>Count total cost. </li>
    <li> Show total cost. </li>
    <li> Still possible to reset the cart. </li>
</ul>

## Version 3.0
